# PyQt5-Hardware-Display
Just a very simple GUI app I made in my free time, in awe of the functionality WMI provides. I will further elaborate on this project when I can, as finding a method or library to get real-time hardware info other than simple psutil features.


Made with PyQt5, no Qt Designer/Ui files of any sort used, pure code.
